# Part 2: Write queries

# Get the brand with the **id** of 8.
brand_id_8 = Brand.query.filter_by(id=8).one()

# Get all models with the **name** Corvette and the **brand_name** Chevrolet.
corvettes = Model.query.filter_by(name='Covette', brand_name='Chevrolet').all()

# Get all models that are older than 1960.
old_cars = Model.query.filter(Model.year < 1960).all()

# Get all brands that were founded after 1920.
new_brands = Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded > 1920).all()

# Get all models with names that begin with "Cor".
model_names = Model.query.filter(Model.name.like('Cor%')).all()

# Get all brands with that were founded in 1903 and that are not yet discontinued.
not_discontinued = Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded == 1903,
                                      Brand.discontinued.is_(None))
not_discontinued = not_discontinued.all()

# Get all brands with that are either discontinued or founded before 1950.
brands = Brand.query.filter((Brand.discontinued.isnot(None)|
                             (Brand.founded < 1950))).all()

# Get any model whose brand_name is not Chevrolet.
not_chevie = Model.query.filter(Model.brand_name != 'Chevrolet').all()

# ==== Discussion questions:
# What is the returned value and datatype of Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')?
    # This method returns 'flask_sqlalchemy.BaseQuery' object. This object's
    # value is the query wherein the brand name is equal to 'Ford'. 
# In your own words, what is an association table, and what type of relationship
# (many to one, many to many, one to one, etc.) does an association
# table manage?
    # An association table is used when you have two related concepts in which
    # there is a meny-to-meny relationship. If we wanted to keep
    # track of which authors wrote which books and we had a table of books,
    # a table for authors, and a table which kept track of each unique
    # author/book contination, then the latter table would be an assocation
    # table. In the example the association table is only keeping track of the
    # relationship between authors and books (as one book can have more than
    # one author), and nothing else.

# Fill in the following functions. (See directions for more info.)

# does an association table manage?
